The NYC Rental Dataset provides rental prices for ZIP codes in New York City from 2015 to 2024, while the Housing Value Dataset includes housing prices for ZIP codes across the U.S. in 2023. Our goal is to analyze trends in NYC rental and housing prices.  rephrase the sentence.

There are 116 months between January 2015 and August 2024, but many ZIP codes in the NYC Rental dataset have fewer than 116 observations. This could be due to properties not being rented out consistently every month.

Manhattan has the highest rental prices, with a steady increase, particularly after the pandemic, and several high outliers exceeding $7,000 in 2024. Brooklyn and Queens display similar upward trends, with moderate price declines during 2020â€“2021 due to the pandemic, followed by strong recovery starting in 2022. Staten Island has the lowest rental prices, with minimal fluctuations. The Bronx shows gradual price growth, though the overall price range remains lower than in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

CA, NY, and MA have the highest median house prices and the widest range, with many outliers over 4000000. States with booming metropolitan areas show both higher median prices and greater price variability.
* AL, MS, and OH exhibit much lower and more uniform house prices, with smaller spreads and no extreme outliers. States in the Midwest and South have more affordable and consistent housing prices.

There is a positive correlation between rental and housing prices, with ZIP codes that have higher rental prices also tending to have higher housing prices.
The majority of data points are clustered within the range of $2,000â€“$4,000 for rental prices and $500,000â€“$1,500,000 for housing prices.
A few outliers are present, including one ZIP code with a housing price exceeding $3 million, despite having a relatively moderate rental price of around $4,000.

Comment:
The scatter plot reveals a positive correlation between average rental and housing prices across ZIP codes, indicated by the upward-sloping trend line. This trend suggests that areas with higher rental prices typically also have higher property values.

Limitations:

Missing Data: Some ZIP codes are missing either rental or housing prices, which could bias the analysis.
Lack of Borough-Level Grouping: ZIP codes are not categorized by borough, making it more difficult to compare rental and housing prices across different boroughs and assess regional price variations.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
